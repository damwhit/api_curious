#ApIcUrIoUs

This app was made to learn how to consume an api.  I used instagram's api to make a very elementary version of their app.  
  
 To fire up the app, clone the repo and run ```bundle``` and ```rake db:setup```. The test suite is in RSpec and can be run with the command 'rspec'.  Please note that you can only sign in if you are signed up on Instagram's developer site.  It is also only interesting if you have other developer friends in your sandbox as your feed won't populate if you have no one in it.  If you do however, you are able to see a feed like you can in regular instagram and you are able to add and delete comments on your own photos.
